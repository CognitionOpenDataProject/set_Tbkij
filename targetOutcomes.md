For this article you should focus on the findings for Experiment 1 reported in section 2.2. Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> 2.2. Results

> All the participants initiated their actions during the second rotation of the Libet clock in the AE and AEA conditions. In addition, the response times for the second movement in the AEA condition suggest that participants had followed the instruction to respond to the tone rather than simply making two movements, one after the other without reference to the tone. [If the time between the tone and the second movement was 100 ms or less, then that trial was excluded from analysis.] On average, the response time to the tone was 310 ± 67 ms, a value that is consistent with reacting to the tone rather than simply making a ‘double’ movement. This means that the average interval between the two movements was more than 500 ms, given that the tone always occurred 250 ms after the first movement – an inter-movement interval that suggests that the movements were independent rather than linked. Moreover, after excluding one outlier, the Pearson Product Moment correlation (r) across participants between response times in the EA condition and the AEA condition was 0.54 (p < 0.05), again suggesting that the second action in AEA condition was a reaction to the tone as was the action in EA condition. Fig. 2 depicts the mean difference scores (perceived minus real stimulus onsets) for all participants across conditions. The data from one participant who did not understand the task was excluded. The mean ± SD difference scores for the E, EA, AE and AEA conditions were 141.2 ± 45.1 ms, 200.5 ± 61.8 ms, 20.5 ± 134.3 ms, and 129.4 ± 116.2 ms respectively. The perceived delay in the tone was larger in the EA condition (p = 0.002) and smaller in the AE condition (p = 0.001) than in the E condition. There was no significant difference between the perceived delay in the AEA condition and that in the E condition (p = 0.683).

> A one-way ANOVA revealed a significant effect of conditions (F(2, 36) = 20.62, p < 0.001) on the standardized difference scores (where the difference scores for each participant in the E condition was subtracted from his or her difference score in the EA, AE, and AEA conditions). The post hoc tests revealed that the standardized difference scores were larger (more positive) in the EA condition than in the AE and AEA conditions (p = 0.000 and p = 0.012 respectively). The standardized difference score was smaller (less positive) in the AE condition than in the AEA condition (p = 0.003). In summary, temporal binding occurred both when an action triggered an event and when an event triggered an action. However, the binding (as indicated by a smaller perceived delay) was decreased when an action followed an action – event sequence.
